Ronald is a fire breathing dragon with green and blue scales. 
He lives in the Tahoe National Forest in California right next to Fallen Leak Lake. 
His job is to light the campfires for people who come to visit.

He is the great-grandson of Toothless. He misses Hiccup.
He loves when people serve him fish. Beware he gets angry if you serve him electric eels. 
He is the only living light-knight fury or is he?

One day, Ronald was wandering through the forrest when he Heard a large boom.
Curious, He set off towards the source.
As he approached the site, he came accross a great fire.
Then, through a clearing in the treees, Ronald saw something he thought he'd nev
er see: another dragon just like him.

This dragon was a lot smaller than Ronald.
It looked pretty helpless, so Ronald approached cautiously.
Ronald asked the dragon what his name was, to which he replied "Bob".
Ronald and Bob quickly became friends.

Then suddently the fire engulfed a tree and the entire forest burst into flames.
Ronald and Bob panicked! They didn't know what to do, but luckly
their friend Jerry the locness monster who lived in Fallen Leaf Lake left out
of the water to send a giant wave of water there way! And thats how Lake Tahoe 
was made!
