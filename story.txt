Ronald is a fire breathing dragon with green and blue scales. 
He lives in the Tahoe National Forest in California right next to Fallen Leak Lake. 
His job is to light the campfires for people who come to visit.
He is the great-grandson of Toothless. He misses Hiccup.
He loves when people serve him fish. Beware he gets angry if you serve him electric eels. 
He is the only living light-knight fury or is he?
